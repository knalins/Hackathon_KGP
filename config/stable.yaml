# Stabilized Training Configuration
# Fixes for small dataset (80 samples) training instability

# Model Architecture
model:
  n_layer: 4          # Reduced - less overfitting on small data
  n_embd: 128         # Reduced - match data size
  n_head: 4
  mlp_multiplier: 64  # Reduced
  vocab_size: 256
  dropout: 0.3        # Increased - more regularization

# Retrieval
retrieval:
  top_k: 10           # Reduced - less noise
  similarity_type: cosine

# Aggregation
aggregation:
  strategy: max
  top_k: 3

# Data Processing
data:
  chunk_size: 1024
  chunk_overlap: 256
  max_backstory_tokens: 512
  max_chunk_tokens: 512
  validation_split: 0.15  # Keep more for training

# Paths
paths:
  data_dir: "./data"
  train_csv: "train - train.csv"

# Training - STABILIZED
training:
  epochs: 50
  learning_rate: 0.0001    # 10x lower - more stable
  weight_decay: 0.01       # Lower - less aggressive
  warmup_epochs: 5         # Warmup for stability
  gradient_accumulation: 4 # Accumulate for smoother gradients
  max_grad_norm: 0.5       # Clip gradients more
  use_amp: true
  compile: false           # Disable for debugging
  log_freq: 5
  save_every: 10

# Loss
loss:
  margin_weight: 0.05      # Lower - less aggressive
  margin: 0.2

# Reproducibility
seed: 42

# Device
device: cuda
